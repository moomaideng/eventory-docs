│   ├── tournaments/ ## Person B: Discovery & Details (Explore, Detail Tabs)
│   ├── organizer/   ## Person C: Organizer Hub & Tournament Creation Wizard

## 5. Peer Review Checklist for Teammates

- [ ] Are the **4 core flows** (Auth, Discovery, Organizer Lifecycle, Team Lobby) clear and sufficient for Sprint 1?
- [ ] Is the page routing structure logical and easy to navigate?
- [ ] Are there any missing pages or duplicate responsibilities in the list above?
